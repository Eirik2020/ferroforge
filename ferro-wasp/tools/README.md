# FerroWasp RTT Terminal MVP

This is the smallest host path for seeing drone firmware text in a Python terminal.

The firmware already uses `defmt-rtt`, so RTT bytes are not plain UTF-8. The
Python script runs a quiet build from the selected firmware app, then launches
`probe-rs run` so probe-rs decodes
the defmt RTT stream and keeps printing live firmware lines. Build warnings are
hidden on successful builds, but shown if the build fails.

## Run

Connect the probe and target, then run from the repository root:

```powershell
python tools\terminal_embed.py
```

The default board is FerroWasp FCU3. After an SWD connection has been fitted to
the Foxeer F405 V2, select its isolated app explicitly. The Foxeer app now also
defaults to its normal DShot600/eRPM-qualified flight path:

```powershell
python tools\terminal_embed.py --board foxeer-f405-v2 --release --locked
```

This builds `apps/foxeer-f405-v2`, flashes its own
`FerroWaspFoxeerF405V2` ELF through `probe-rs`, and decodes RTT. PA13/SWDIO and
PA14/SWCLK are reserved by the Foxeer board support and are not configured as LEDs.
The host prints explicit milestones so a quiet or slow probe cannot be mistaken
for a stalled command:

```text
HOST: === FLASH STARTED: connecting, erasing, and programming ===
HOST: === FLASH ACTIVE: erase/program transfer observed ===
HOST: === FLASH PROGRAMMED: waiting for firmware boot/RTT ===
HOST: === FLASH SUCCEEDED: firmware boot and RTT observed ===
```

An attach/program failure prints `HOST: === FLASH FAILED: ... ===` and returns
a nonzero exit code. `FLASH PROGRAMMED` alone is not a complete success; wait
for `FLASH SUCCEEDED`, which proves the programmed firmware booted far enough
to produce RTT.

For the first retrofitted SWD connection, use the self-terminating smoke test:

```powershell
python tools\terminal_embed.py --foxeer-smoke
```

This uses the normal arming-inhibited release image, waits through programming,
then listens for 14 seconds after firmware boot. It checks boot/RTT/IMU/EXTI
evidence, prints a PASS/FAIL summary, and interrupts `probe-rs` cleanly. It does
not enable a motor commissioning feature. The command automatically adds the
Foxeer `imu_transport_rtt` diagnostic and `smoke_actuator_inhibit` features, so
the flight-capable default remains compile-time actuator-locked for this test.
Routine Foxeer builds omit periodic IMU raw/DRDY lines to keep RTT available
for operational evidence.

You can also run `python terminal_embed.py` from inside the `tools` directory.

Use `--board`, `--release`, `--locked`, and `--features` to build and run a specific
bench image. For example:

```powershell
python tools\terminal_embed.py --release --locked --features "bench_equal_motors bench_dshot_unequal_motors"
```

Expected first useful lines include boot, IMU detection, battery, and heartbeat
startup messages:

```text
DRONE: [INFO ] FerroWasp RTT hello from drone
DRONE: [INFO ] Running heartbeat!
```

The default firmware heartbeat is intentionally quiet in RTT after startup, but
it alternates the red/green debug LEDs about once per second as a visible
liveness indicator. Use the `blackbox_defmt` feature when you want continuous
IMU/control-loop samples.

Every terminal line is also written to a timestamped log file:

```text
logs\terminal_embed\YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_rtt.log
```

The file is flushed after every line, so output already received remains
readable after `Ctrl+C` or an interrupted target run. This line-oriented
capture is preferable to piping cargo-embed through `Tee-Object`, because
cargo-embed's interactive terminal output can contain cursor and ANSI control
sequences. Default build-and-run mode also records the exact firmware ELF path
and SHA-256 before `probe-rs` starts, keeping each retained log tied to its
artifact.

To choose the log path:

```powershell
python tools\terminal_embed.py --log-file logs\bench_rtt.log
```

To pass a custom command:

```powershell
python tools\terminal_embed.py -- probe-rs run --chip STM32F405RG --protocol swd --no-location --no-timestamps apps\stm32f405-flight\target\thumbv7em-none-eabihf\debug\FerroWasp
```

## IMU Live View

To build, flash/run, log, and live-plot the current telemetry stream:

```powershell
python tools\imu_live_view.py
```

The viewer launches `terminal_embed.py`. With `blackbox_defmt` firmware it reads
BB2 frames and shows control-loop plots for gyro-vs-command rates, PID output,
throttle, and motors. By default it does not echo every RTT line because 400 Hz
blackbox output can make the UI lag; pass `--echo-rtt` when raw terminal echo is
more important than plot smoothness.

Older heartbeat-IMU firmware can still use the attitude-view options. To
continuously ground roll/pitch with accel while still integrating gyro motion:

```powershell
python tools\imu_live_view.py --attitude accel
```

The default mode is:

```powershell
python tools\imu_live_view.py --attitude gyro
```

To attach through the remote Pi probe-rs server and live-view the already-running
firmware:

```powershell
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link cable
```

For the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W gateway:

```powershell
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link zero
```

For the Zero 2 W on the mobile router:

```powershell
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link zeromobile
```

The remote viewer uses `FERROWASP_PROBE_HOST` and `FERROWASP_PROBE_TOKEN` when
they are set. It can also read ignored local defaults from
`local_config/ferrowasp.local.json`; see `local_config/ferrowasp.example.json`.

The old `accel_live_plot.py` name still works as a compatibility wrapper.

## IMU Noise Analyzer

To estimate whether the filtered gyro rates are quiet enough for the PID while
the FCU is sitting still, run:

```powershell
python tools\imu_noise_analyzer.py --latest
```

Or capture directly from the FCU/IMU without running motors:

```powershell
python tools\imu_noise_analyzer.py --capture 30
```

The analyzer compares raw gyro data, remapped into the PID roll/pitch/yaw
convention, against the filtered control-axis rates that the PID sees. It prints
per-axis standard deviation, peak-to-peak noise, filter attenuation, drift, and a
rough quiet/watch/noisy verdict. Keep the frame still during capture.

## Remote Pi Probe

The PowerShell remote-probe helpers in this repo are compatibility wrappers
around the sibling FerroDebugger repo. FerroWasp still owns building the
firmware ELF and the blackbox/RTT schema; FerroDebugger owns Pi links,
`probe-rs serve`, Pi setup, Zero 2 W migration, detached logging, and log fetch.

By default the wrappers look for FerroDebugger at:

```text
..\ferro-debugger
```

Override that with:

```powershell
$env:FERRODEBUGGER_REPO = "C:\path\to\ferro-debugger"
```

When `probe-rs serve` is running on a configured FerroDebugger link, these
helpers use the Raspberry Pi GPIO/SPI SWD probe through the remote probe-rs
WebSocket API:

```powershell
.\tools\remote_info.ps1 -Link Cable
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link Cable -Build
.\tools\remote_attach.ps1 -Link Cable
.\tools\remote_attach_log.ps1 -Link Cable
.\tools\pi_log_start.ps1 -Link Cable
.\tools\pi_log_stop.ps1 -Link Cable
.\tools\pi_log_fetch.ps1 -Link Cable
.\tools\pi_elf_sync.ps1 -Link Cable
```

Zero 2 W equivalents use the `Zero` link on bench Wi-Fi:

```powershell
.\tools\remote_info.ps1 -Link Zero -VerboseProbe
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link Zero -Build -Features blackbox_defmt
.\tools\pi_elf_sync.ps1 -Link Zero
.\tools\pi_log_start.ps1 -Link Zero -Restart
.\tools\pi_log_stop.ps1 -Link Zero
.\tools\pi_log_fetch.ps1 -Link Zero
```

Zero 2 W on the mobile router uses `ZeroMobile`:

```powershell
.\tools\remote_info.ps1 -Link ZeroMobile -VerboseProbe
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link ZeroMobile -Build -Features blackbox_defmt
.\tools\pi_elf_sync.ps1 -Link ZeroMobile
.\tools\pi_log_start.ps1 -Link ZeroMobile -Restart
.\tools\pi_log_stop.ps1 -Link ZeroMobile
.\tools\pi_log_fetch.ps1 -Link ZeroMobile
```

Command summary:

- `remote_info.ps1` checks the remote SWD connection through the Pi. It does
  not flash or reset the FCU.
- `remote_run.ps1` flashes the selected ELF, resets/runs the STM32, and streams
  RTT/defmt output. Use `-Build` to build a fresh release first. Pass
  `-Features blackbox_defmt` to include the 400 Hz compact blackbox frames.
- `remote_attach.ps1` attaches to firmware that is already running and streams
  RTT/defmt output. It does not reflash; the local ELF should match the running
  firmware so defmt decoding is correct.
- `remote_attach_log.ps1` does the same attach-only RTT session, while also
  writing the complete terminal output to `logs\remote_probe\*_attach.log`.
- `pi_log_start.ps1` starts a detached attach logger on the Pi. It keeps
  running if the SSH session disconnects.
- `pi_log_auto.ps1` starts a detached attach logger on the Pi that writes
  armed-window `rtt-auto-*.log` files by watching BB1/BB2 armed flags.
- `pi_log_stop.ps1` stops the detached Pi logger.
- `pi_log_fetch.ps1` copies the latest Pi-side log into `logs\remote_probe`.
- `pi_elf_sync.ps1` copies the current local ELF to the Pi path used by
  `pi_log_start.ps1` for `defmt` decoding.

Link defaults, tokens, Pi users, remote ELF paths, and probe settings now live
in FerroDebugger config:

```text
..\ferro-debugger\config\ferrodebugger.local.json
```

Most helpers accept a named Pi link:

```powershell
.\tools\remote_info.ps1 -Link Cable
.\tools\remote_info.ps1 -Link Mobile
.\tools\remote_info.ps1 -Link Zero
.\tools\remote_info.ps1 -Link ZeroMobile
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link Cable -Build
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link Mobile -Build
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link Zero -Build
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link ZeroMobile -Build
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link cable
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link mobile
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link zero
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link zeromobile
```

Use `Cable` when the laptop is on normal internet Wi-Fi and the Pi is connected
by Ethernet. Use `Mobile` when the laptop and Pi are both on the configured
mobile router.
Use `Zero` for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W gateway on bench Wi-Fi. Use
`ZeroMobile` when the Zero and laptop are both on the mobile router.

Legacy parameters such as `-HostUri`, `-Token`, `-PiUser`, `-RemoteElf`,
`-Chip`, `-Probe`, and `-Speed` are accepted by the compatibility wrappers but
ignored. Configure those values in FerroDebugger instead.

To install the Pi boot/restart service:

```powershell
.\tools\install_probe_rs_service.ps1 -Link Zero -Token "your-token"
```

For local convenience without committing private bench defaults, copy
`local_config\ferrowasp.example.json` to `local_config\ferrowasp.local.json` and
set `mobile_ssid` and `probe_token` there. The local file is ignored by Git.

To choose a specific attach log path:

```powershell
.\tools\remote_attach_log.ps1 -Link Cable -LogFile logs\bench_attach.log
```

For onboard or disconnected logging:

```powershell
.\tools\pi_log_start.ps1 -Link Cable
# disconnect/reconnect later
.\tools\pi_log_stop.ps1 -Link Cable
.\tools\pi_log_fetch.ps1 -Link Cable
```

On the mobile router:

```powershell
.\tools\pi_log_start.ps1 -Link Mobile -Restart
.\tools\pi_log_stop.ps1 -Link Mobile
.\tools\pi_log_fetch.ps1 -Link Mobile
```

For armed-window auto logging on the Zero/mobile-router setup:

```powershell
.\tools\pi_log_auto.ps1 -Link ZeroMobile -Restart
# fly one or more armed tests
.\tools\pi_log_auto.ps1 -Link ZeroMobile -Stop
.\tools\pi_log_fetch.ps1 -Link ZeroMobile
```

The auto logger attaches once, keeps a short pre-arm buffer, writes while BB
frames report `armed`, and closes the segment a few seconds after disarm. The
normal `pi_log_fetch.ps1` command fetches the latest closed or active auto log.

Bench safety: `remote_run.ps1` resets and starts the flashed firmware. Keep
props off and ESC power in the intended safe state before running it.

## 400 Hz Blackbox Defmt Frames

The current firmware cannot safely link `rtt-target` beside `defmt-rtt`; the
installed `defmt-rtt` backend owns the SEGGER RTT control block and exposes one
RTT up-channel. For the MVP, high-rate bench logging therefore uses compact
fixed-point `defmt` frames over the existing RTT stream.

Build and flash the blackbox-enabled firmware:

```powershell
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link Cable -Build -Features blackbox_defmt
```

For the Foxeer F405 V2 over the retrofitted local SWD connection:

```powershell
python tools\terminal_embed.py --board foxeer-f405-v2 --release --locked --features blackbox_defmt
```

Start with the ESC unpowered and leave the craft stationary for at least ten
seconds. The Foxeer EXTI-driven IMU should produce about `1000 Hz` in the
analyzer's `Sequence/timing` report, normally with contiguous IMU deltas `2`
and `3` at the unchanged 400 Hz control rate. Repeated IMU samples should be
zero. `missing BB2 frames` measures RTT transport loss, not sensor loss, and
may be nonzero if the terminal cannot drain the human-readable stream quickly.

For a clean motor-vibration check that disables the PID/mixer and commands all
four motors equally through the normal actuator-output task, build with the
bench equal-motor feature:

```powershell
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link Cable -Build -Features "blackbox_defmt bench_equal_motors"
```

In this mode the aircraft must still be armed normally. The firmware caps the
requested throttle to `250` PWM-style units, logs PID as zero, and logs motors as
`[throttle; 4]`. Use it only with propellers removed, and stop immediately if a
motor or ESC smokes, smells hot, jitters abnormally, or heats rapidly.

For the normal FCU3 DShot600 firmware, build without `bench_equal_motors`:

```powershell
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link Cable -Build -Features blackbox_defmt
```

The current normal profile is intentionally conservative: roll P/I/D
`0.20 / 0.00 / 0.00`, pitch P/I/D `0.25 / 0.00 / 0.00`, and yaw P/I/D
`0.30 / 0.04 / 0.00`.

The legacy `bench_motorN_only` modes select physical PWM outputs and are
compile-time incompatible with the default DShot image. Do not add them to the
commands above. For DShot motor identity, use the capped logical modes below;
they exercise the committed mixer-to-output map through the normal safety-owned
actuator path.

To verify the active mixer-to-output remap, use the logical motor modes instead.
These command a logical mixer motor and then apply `MOTOR_OUTPUT_MAP` before
touching the physical outputs.

```powershell
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link Cable -Build -Features "blackbox_defmt bench_equal_motors bench_logical_motor1_only"
```

```powershell
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link Cable -Build -Features "blackbox_defmt bench_equal_motors bench_logical_motor2_only"
```

```powershell
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link Cable -Build -Features "blackbox_defmt bench_equal_motors bench_logical_motor3_only"
```

```powershell
.\tools\remote_run.ps1 -Link Cable -Build -Features "blackbox_defmt bench_equal_motors bench_logical_motor4_only"
```

With the current remap, logical M1/M2/M3/M4 spin rear-right, front-right,
rear-left, and front-left respectively. Verified rotation is M1 CW, M2 CCW,
M3 CCW, and M4 CW. These modes require propellers removed and remain capped.

The control loop emits one `BB2` frame at the 400 Hz PID rate. Disarmed frames
still include raw gyro, filtered gyro, command, throttle, and freshness flags;
PID and motor fields are zeroed until the craft is armed.

```text
BB2 seq 1234 imu 5678 flags 3 raw10 [12, -21, 6] gyro10 [10, -20, 5] cmd10 [0, 0, 0] pid [1, -2, 0] thr 1175 motors [1175, 1176, 1174, 1175]
```

Field meaning:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `seq` | Control-rate sample sequence |
| `imu` | IMU sample sequence used by this control update |
| `flags` | Bit 0 armed, bit 1 IMU fresh |
| `raw10` | Unfiltered roll, pitch, yaw gyro rates in 0.1 deg/s |
| `gyro10` | Filtered roll, pitch, yaw gyro rates in 0.1 deg/s |
| `cmd10` | Commanded roll, pitch, yaw rates in 0.1 deg/s |
| `pid` | Total PID output per axis in controller output units |
| `thr` | Throttle setpoint in PWM-style command units |
| `motors` | Mixed motor commands in PWM-style command units |

This is still human-decodable `defmt` output, not a dedicated binary RTT
channel. The future path is to replace the RTT backend deliberately so channel 0
can carry `defmt` and channel 1 can carry raw binary blackbox samples.

The live viewer auto-detects these frames. With blackbox firmware running:

```powershell
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link cable
```

On the Zero 2 W gateway:

```powershell
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link zero
```

On the Zero 2 W mobile-router link:

```powershell
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link zeromobile
```

When `BB1` or `BB2` lines appear, the viewer shows control-loop plots for
gyro-vs-command rates, PID output, throttle, and motors.
If the PC still struggles, lower the UI refresh rate:

```powershell
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link cable --ui-hz 15
```

```powershell
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link zero --ui-hz 15
```

```powershell
python tools\imu_live_view.py --remote --link zeromobile --ui-hz 15
```

For offline analysis after a Pi-side recording:

If you rebuilt/flashed from the PC and plan to log on the Pi, sync the matching
ELF first so `defmt` decoding uses the right metadata:

```powershell
.\tools\pi_elf_sync.ps1 -Link Cable
```

```powershell
.\tools\pi_log_start.ps1 -Link Cable -Restart
# run the bench test
.\tools\pi_log_stop.ps1 -Link Cable
.\tools\pi_log_fetch.ps1 -Link Cable
python tools\blackbox_analyzer.py --csv logs\remote_probe\latest_blackbox.csv
```

For a local SWD capture, stop `terminal_embed.py` after the test and run the
same analyzer without a path; it automatically selects the newest local or
remote RTT log:

```powershell
python tools\blackbox_analyzer.py --mode rest --csv logs\terminal_embed\latest_blackbox.csv
```

For deliberate hand-motion/swing tests, the default `--mode auto` should classify
large low-frequency gyro movement as motion. Use `--mode rest` for stationary
noise-floor or motor-vibration checks where large filtered gyro standard
deviation should be treated as noise:

```powershell
python tools\blackbox_analyzer.py --mode rest
```

For a hand-swing recording, trim the pickup and place-down sections by time:

```powershell
python tools\blackbox_analyzer.py --mode swing --trim-start 6 --trim-end 6 --csv logs\remote_probe\swing_trimmed.csv
```

With no log argument, the analyzer uses the newest `.log` in `logs\remote_probe`
or `logs\terminal_embed`. You can also pass a specific fetched log:

```powershell
python tools\blackbox_analyzer.py logs\remote_probe\pi_20260710_193000_attach.log --csv logs\remote_probe\swing_test.csv
```

## Foxeer Onboard Flash CLI

The preferred end-user path is the Rust
[`ferro-configurator`](ferro-configurator/README.md), which ships with the
ready Foxeer image and supports all current settings, selective/resumable
downloads, range downloads, confirmed erase, and ULog conversion without
Python:

```powershell
ferro-configurator.exe --port COM7 config show
ferro-configurator.exe --port COM7 blackbox flights
ferro-configurator.exe --port COM7 blackbox download `
  --flight latest --output logs\foxeer-latest.fwbb `
  --ulog logs\foxeer-latest.ulg
```

The Python tools below remain lower-level development and analysis references.

`ferrowasp_storage.py` talks to the Foxeer USB CDC storage endpoint. Install
its only optional host dependency with `python -m pip install pyserial`.
Start with the standard image and identify the actual JEDEC device before any destructive command:

```powershell
python tools\terminal_embed.py --board foxeer-f405-v2 --release --locked
python tools\ferrowasp_storage.py --port COM7 info
python tools\ferrowasp_storage.py --port COM7 list
```

The expected capacity code for 16 MiB is `18`. Do not assume the manufacturer
or memory-type bytes; record what the fitted device reports. For the first destructive verification, remain disarmed and test only the permanently reserved scratch sector:

```powershell
python tools\terminal_embed.py --board foxeer-f405-v2 --release --locked
python tools\ferrowasp_storage.py --port COM7 test --confirm
```

After the standard blackbox service has recorded a props-off armed/disarmed session,
download its CRC-protected raw pages and analyze them with the existing tool:

```powershell
python tools\terminal_embed.py --board foxeer-f405-v2 --release --locked --probe-speed-khz 1800 --connect-under-reset
python tools\ferrowasp_storage.py --port COM7 list
python tools\ferrowasp_storage.py --port COM7 erase --confirm
python tools\ferrowasp_storage.py --port COM7 list
# Reboot or reflash the same image after erase, then record the armed session.
python tools\ferrowasp_storage.py --port COM7 read --output logs\foxeer-props-off.fwbb
python tools\blackbox_analyzer.py logs\foxeer-props-off.fwbb --mode auto --csv logs\foxeer-props-off.csv
```

If a long USB download is interrupted, validate the complete pages already on
disk and continue without restarting from page zero:

```powershell
python tools\ferrowasp_storage.py --port COM7 --timeout 10 read --resume --output logs\foxeer-props-off.fwbb
```

Downloads may contain several armed sessions. Select one flight for sequence,
rate, and jitter analysis so boundaries between flight IDs are not counted as
missing frames:

```powershell
python tools\blackbox_analyzer.py logs\foxeer-props-off.fwbb --flight-id latest --mode auto --csv logs\foxeer-latest.csv
```

For routine downloads, inspect the flight catalog and transfer only the desired
contiguous page range:

```powershell
python tools\ferrowasp_storage.py --port COM7 flights
python tools\ferrowasp_storage.py --port COM7 read --flight-id latest --output logs\foxeer-latest.fwbb
```

`--flight-id` also accepts a numeric ID. The host finds the range with bounded
page probes instead of downloading older flights. `--resume` validates every
existing page against the selected flight ID, page sequence, and CRC before
continuing:

```powershell
python tools\ferrowasp_storage.py --port COM7 read --flight-id 12 --resume --output logs\foxeer-flight12.fwbb
```

New firmware marks the first stored flight after each MCU boot. The `flights`
view groups subsequent flights beneath that boot heading. Pre-marker pages are
reported as `boot unknown`; no timestamp heuristic is used to invent historical
power-cycle boundaries.

`erase --confirm` erases every sector in the log partition, not the
configuration slots or scratch sector. Storage reads and all writes are
rejected while armed; in-progress erase/config/self-test maintenance is
aborted if arming begins. The CLI has no actuator or safety authority.
The initial erase must end with `used pages: 0` and `writable: True`. Rebooting
afterward resets the expected disarmed-record drops accumulated while flash
maintenance was busy, so record-drop evidence from the actual capture starts
clean.
For `.fwbb` input the analyzer rejects every invalid or truncated page and
prints the CRC-valid page count, record count, flight IDs, page-sequence
endpoints, partial-page count, and final-page record count before its normal
BB2 analysis. `--flight-id N` selects an explicit stored flight and
`--flight-id latest` selects the highest available ID.

## FWBB to ULog Converter

FerroConfigurator now provides the normal native conversion command:

```powershell
ferro-configurator.exe convert logs\foxeer-flight.fwbb `
  --flight latest `
  --output logs\foxeer-flight-latest.ulg
```

`fwbb_to_ulog.py` remains the Python reference implementation. It converts one
CRC-validated onboard flight into the same compact ULog file and selects the
latest flight by default:

```powershell
python tools\fwbb_to_ulog.py logs\foxeer-flight.fwbb `
  --flight-id latest `
  --output logs\foxeer-flight-latest.ulg
```

The single `ferrowasp_rate_control` topic contains the BB2 raw/filtered gyro
rates, rate setpoints, PID effort, throttle, four motor commands, sequence
counters, and safety/freshness flags. Its timestamp is elapsed microseconds
from the first selected sample. Sequence gaps are represented with standard
ULog dropout messages. The conversion is deterministic and never combines
separate flight IDs.

This is a host-side migration/visualization path. Firmware continues to record
the existing fixed-size `.fwbb` pages until a bounded native ULog storage path
is designed and verified.

## Flight Reports

To create a report folder with a markdown summary and plots:

```powershell
python tools\flight_report.py logs\remote_probe\rtt-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log --trim-start 3 --trim-end 3
```

With no source argument, the newest `.log` or `.csv` in `logs\remote_probe` is
used:

```powershell
python tools\flight_report.py --trim-start 3 --trim-end 3
```

Reports are written under:

```text
logs\remote_probe\reports\<source-name>\report.md
```

The generated plots include setpoint-vs-measured rate, rate tracking error, PID
output, motor output, and zooms around the worst tracking-error events.

## App Context Router

`app_context.py` is a deterministic, read-only map for the large FCU3 and
Foxeer RTIC app shells. It reports relevant task/helper ranges, priorities,
interrupt bindings, feature gates, resource-block anchors, companion files,
and potential test-catalog routes without printing the complete source.
Foxeer topics include the matching FCU3 golden-app anchors.

Run it from the repository root:

```powershell
python tools\app_context.py --list-topics
python tools\app_context.py --board fcu3 --topic control
python tools\app_context.py --board foxeer-f405-v2 --topic arming
python tools\app_context.py --validate
```

Output is capped at 8 KiB. Route validation fails on missing source symbols,
companion paths, test IDs, unassigned RTIC tasks, or budget growth. A route
selects context only; it does not change firmware, operate hardware, determine
which tests ultimately apply, or claim that a test passed.

## Test Evidence Metadata

New test results use bounded JSON metadata records described in
`project_meta/testing/evidence/README.md`. Raw logs and reports remain under
ignored `logs/` paths.

Validate the record layout, catalog identity, hardware execution boundary,
artifact metadata, and size limits with:

```powershell
python tools\test_evidence.py
```

The repository-wide `python tools\check_repository_context.py` command runs
the same evidence checks and also validates document registration, immutable
archives, context budgets, and the ADR index/record relationships. Neither
command decides that a test passed or that hardware is safe to operate.

The python tools/check_rtic_boundaries.py command enforces the mechanical
thin-app rules: internal-only RTIC imports, RTIC-only declarations, shared
board data models, no direct timer-register sequencing in board support, and
no exact cross-board Rust source copies.

## Troubleshooting

- Check that the probe is visible to `probe-rs`.
- Check that `Embed.toml` uses `STM32F405RG`.
- Check that the firmware is built with `defmt-rtt`.
- If you only see build output, wait for flashing/reset and RTT attach to finish.
- If another debugger owns the probe, close it before running this script.
