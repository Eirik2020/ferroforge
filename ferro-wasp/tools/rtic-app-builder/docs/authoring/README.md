# Component, endpoint, and capability authoring

This directory is the planned authoring handbook for extending the app
builder. It defines the documentation structure and the common review
checklist before additional protocols such as SBUS or CRSF are added.

It does not define implementation order or target schemas. Those are owned by
`../../RTIC_APP_BUILDER_REFERENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

The working USART1 DMA plus MSP DisplayPort application is the canonical
vertical example. New guides and abstractions should be verified against that
implementation rather than built around hypothetical code.

## Terminology at the implementation boundary

- **Component** — a reusable implementation or functional unit, such as OSD,
  SBUS, battery monitoring, or a UART-DMA driver.
- **Endpoint component** — a reusable hardware-provider implementation, such
  as the STM32F4 UART RX/TX DMA driver.
- **Endpoint instance** — an endpoint component bound to concrete hardware,
  such as USART1, PA9/PA10, DMA2 streams 5/7, buffers, and interrupts.
- **Capability** — a typed semantic contract exposed through ports with
  explicit roles such as publish/consume or emit/handle. It does not transfer
  ownership of the backing peripheral.

The existing OSD example demonstrates the intended chain:

```text
UART-DMA endpoint component
    instantiated as USART1/PA9/PA10/DMA2 endpoint
        publishes bounded RX chunks -> consumed by MSP DisplayPort
        handles bounded TX requests <- emitted by MSP DisplayPort
        MSP reads OsdTelemetry observation
            written only through explicitly modeled demo/observation ports
```

The compatibility prototype now uses distinct bounded work, TX, and
completion channels plus a copied telemetry snapshot. Its endpoint types
remain intentionally USART1-specific. The target metadata vocabulary must
preserve these directed transport edges and must not infer fan-out from one
destructive queue.

## Handbook scope

The completed handbook is expected to contain:

1. `capabilities.md` — define typed contracts, ownership, boundedness, error
   and overflow semantics, timing, configuration, multiplicity, and
   versioning. Capability APIs must not expose HAL or PAC types.
2. `endpoints.md` — define peripheral, pin, DMA, interrupt, buffer, and
   initialization ownership. The USART1 DMA provider is the first worked
   example.
3. `components.md` — define software state and RTIC task ownership, directed
   capability ports and roles, instance-safe naming, and hardware-independent
   logic. MSP DisplayPort is the first worked example.
4. `composition.md` — describe capability matching, insertion ordering,
   exclusive resource claims, priorities, shared logical scheduling, and the
   BSP/application/platform/backend configuration boundaries.
5. `testing.md` — define host tests, manifest validation, resolved-graph
   fixtures, rendered-Rust parsing, complete-checkpoint embedded checks,
   release linking, overflow tests, and hardware smoke tests.

The reference plan determines when each guide and executable example is
created. Do not maintain a second authoring roadmap here.

## Common authoring checklist

Every component, endpoint, and capability guide must answer:

- What does this unit own?
- What interaction kind, safety class, and explicit port role does each
  connection use?
- Which exact SPSC, MPSC, latest-value, journal, same-task, or service
  transport implements each edge?
- Which RTIC hardware, divergent consumer, periodic, or delayed one-shot tasks
  does it introduce?
- Which pins, peripherals, DMA routes, interrupts, and dispatcher capacity
  does it claim?
- What memory is statically allocated, and how are its capacities selected?
- What happens on queue overflow, malformed input, timeout, or hardware error?
- Which configuration belongs to the BSP, application, persisted platform
  configuration, or backend?
- Which failures reject resolution/build, which occur at boot, and which are
  runtime faults? What typed fault sink and arming effect apply?
- What initialization and shutdown/safe-state behavior is required?
- Can multiple instances be generated without symbol or resource collisions?
- Which automated and hardware tests establish that it works?

## Configuration ownership reminder

- The **BSP** declares immutable physical facts: pins, peripheral instances,
  DMA routes, and other board wiring.
- The **application** selects components and owns compile-time behavior such
  as queue capacities, task priorities, and logical periods.
- The persisted **platform configuration** assigns configurable peripherals
  to profiles such as `msp_displayport`, `sbus`, or `crsf` at boot. The
  assignment is frozen until reboot.
- The **backend** translates validated MCU/profile facts into HAL types and
  setup, including alternate functions, DMA direction, electrical policy, and
  the shared monotonic implementation.

## Current implementation versus planned contracts

Today, feature metadata records symbols, required symbols, resources,
interrupts, and insertion ordering. Strict NUCLEO contracts additionally
validate exact task forms, transport topology/capacity/overflow/wake-up,
interaction and safety classifications, typed faults, application safety
scope, and typed/versioned backend mechanisms. These contracts are executable
vertical-slice evidence; the generator does not yet expose them as the general
component catalogue schema.

The planned guides must distinguish executable behavior from proposed schema.
Until typed metadata is implemented, examples should identify capability
relationships in prose and Rust types without presenting speculative manifest
syntax as supported configuration.

## Keeping the handbook current

Authoritative API details should live in Rustdoc beside capability types. The
handbook explains ownership, design choices, and the end-to-end workflow.
Manifest and generated-code snippets should come from checked examples where
possible.

CI should generate and compile every canonical handbook example. A component
is not considered documented when its example no longer passes schema and
resolved-graph validation, embedded `cargo check --locked`, and its applicable
build or target gate.
