# Internal Development Backlog

This is maintainer/session backlog material. Public roadmap-level items should
be reflected in `mdbook/src/roadmap.md`.

## MVP Focus
- Narrow scope to a simple MVP that flies.
- Prioritize the minimum safe flight path: RC input, IMU sampling, arming/disarming, rate loop, mixer, safety-gated motor output, and basic bench/flight telemetry.
- Defer non-essential expansion until the MVP flies predictably: broad protocol support, configurator polish, board generator work, and advanced companion modules.

## Current Work Order - 2026-07-22

1. Prepare a sanitized, accurate public source repository and pass every
   supported target/CI check.
2. Repeat the corrected Foxeer F405 V2 conservative controlled hop; both
   corrective props-off gates and the clean-image boot check have passed.
3. Validate the checked-in WSL 2/Docker reference environment on Docker
   Desktop and keep its pinned tool versions aligned with CI.
4. Resume FCU3 tuning with the isolated pitch P `0.25 -> 0.30` experiment.

## Development Environment TODO

Completed in the rebuilt reference container:

- [x] Git, OpenSSH, Bubblewrap, `unshare`, capability diagnostics, the pinned
  Codex CLI, and the pinned Rust/Python/mdBook tools are installed by the
  image.
- [x] Codex state is stored in the external `ferrowasp-codex-home` volume. The
  UI thread picker retains sessions across recreation; treat the volume as
  private because it also contains login state.
- [x] Compose uses `no-new-privileges` with the reviewed
  `seccomp=unconfined` namespace baseline and does not add capabilities.
- [x] Nested user namespaces and the bounded Bubblewrap smoke test pass in the
  rebuilt container.
- [x] Host SSH-agent forwarding is fail-closed and does not copy private keys
  into the image or repository.
- [x] Hardware-free CI checks the pinned toolchain and non-network Git/SSH and
  namespace prerequisites.

Remaining host acceptance:

- [ ] After the `.devcontainer` file relocation, run
  `bash tools/dev/compose-with-ssh-agent.sh config`, recreate the service if
  required, and run `bash tools/dev/check-rebuilt-container.sh`.
- [ ] Confirm that the rebuilt VS Code and Compose entry points can both use
  the forwarded identity for GitHub authentication and `git fetch`. A managed
  Codex sandbox may be unable to access the agent socket, so perform this check
  in the ordinary container terminal.
- [ ] Replace `seccomp=unconfined` with a reviewed minimal seccomp profile if
  Docker/WSL support permits the required user-namespace syscalls reliably.
- [ ] Add concise recovery guidance for WSL/Docker upgrades, recreation, and
  rerunning the environment acceptance checks.

## Recently Closed

- The safety-owned DShot arming sequence now stops all motors on failed idle
  qualification; the injected physical-output-1 / logical-M4-not-running case
  aborted after 1.2 seconds and never armed.
- Boot, battery reconnect, and FCU reflash while the controller arm level
  remained high did not automatically rearm. A fresh low-to-high transition is
  required.
- The standard DShot600/legacy-telemetry image completed a controlled outdoor
  flight. The previous unwanted yawing was absent by operator report; pitch
  authority is the remaining tuning observation.

## Bug List

- ESC-only power-cycle recovery is incorrectly permanent when USB keeps the
  FCU alive. The PA10 legacy-telemetry manager associates a request with an
  ESC response; when the ESC rail is removed it correctly times out and
  fail-closes, but presently latches telemetry off until an FCU reboot. A later
  arm request therefore permits temporary DShot idle, receives no fresh eRPM
  evidence, and aborts after the 1.2-second all-motor qualification timeout.
  Add an explicit disarmed recovery path: require a fresh ARM-low transition,
  clear pending association/parser/sample state, reapply the five-second ESC
  boot delay, and require a new four-ESC idle qualification. Never recover
  automatically while armed or while ARM remains high. Reproduce props-off
  with USB power retained and an ESC-only battery power cycle; verify the first
  arm fails closed and a later explicit recovery arms only after fresh evidence.
- Independent actuator-deadline detection for a total loss of future motor
  commands is not yet implemented.
- IMU initialization, gyro-bias calibration, and freshness are pre-arm
  prerequisites; negative target fault-injection evidence remains open.
  ADC/OSD freshness policy also remains prototype-level.
- DShot waveform timing, jitter, M4 polarity margin, and TIM1/TIM8 phase still
  require logic-analyzer evidence.

## Telemetry / Debug TODO
- Flight-test telemetry / blackbox improvements from July 14 FPV bring-up:
  - add explicit event/phase markers to BB2 or its successor: boot, gyro-bias
    calibration start/done, arm requested, armed idle, armed active,
    throttle-on, disarm, failsafe, and logger/session start
  - log separate PID contributions per axis, especially yaw P/I/D terms and
    yaw integrator state, so tuning can distinguish rate response from steady
    torque bias and windup
  - log actuator saturation/clamp flags per motor and per update, instead of
    inferring saturation from motor output values after the fact
  - log each fresh legacy-UART ESC observation with physical/logical motor
    identity, eRPM, observation time/age, request sequence, freshness, and
    parser/association health. Use the maximum bounded rate delivered by the
    sequential telemetry manager; do not copy one stale value into every
    control-rate record without marking it stale
  - build an offline per-motor command-to-eRPM characterization pipeline from
    synchronized motor command, fresh eRPM, battery voltage, and steady-state
    qualifiers. Convert electrical RPM to mechanical RPM when motor pole-pair
    count is known. Fit a bounded monotonic LUT, retain its source-flight and
    configuration provenance, and validate it across pack voltage, propeller
    load, temperature, and maneuvering before using it as motor feedforward
    linearization. Do not close a fast RPM feedback loop around sequential
    low-rate legacy telemetry
  - log body-frame accelerometer data for crash-detector development. Prefer
    raw or minimally filtered per-axis samples with timestamp/sequence,
    configured scale, and clipping state; if storage cannot sustain that rate,
    retain bounded per-window peaks plus enough surrounding samples to replay
    impacts. Develop and validate detection offline before granting it any
    disarm or safety-state effect
  - prototype crash/stall classification from a causal sequence: an armed
    acceleration impulse followed by a sufficiently commanded motor producing
    fresh, valid eRPM below its voltage-aware LUT expectation for a bounded
    duration. Treat missing/stale telemetry separately from a valid low-eRPM
    response. Use the later pilot/failsafe DISARM event as an offline label and
    validation signal only, never as an input to the detector that would have
    to request that disarm. Cover throttle cuts, low-command motors during
    attitude control, hard landings, prop unloading, ESC desync, and telemetry
    loss in false-positive tests
  - embed a versioned configuration snapshot in every flight log at the flight
    boundary, and emit another record after any accepted runtime change: roll,
    pitch, yaw P/I/D, filter alpha, RC deadband and per-axis rates/expo, motor
    map, gyro axis/sign map, output limits, board/firmware identity, and the
    persisted configuration sequence. Host tools and ULog conversion must
    expose this metadata and warn if a flight lacks it; a boot-only print is
    insufficient because several flights and tune changes can share one boot
    session
  - add RC link quality and freshness fields: frame age, dropped/error frames,
    failsafe status, and channel decode health
  - add IMU freshness and bias-calibration fields: bias ready, calibration
    sample count, raw bias values, stale ticks, and calibration rejection reason
  - calibrate and log battery current/voltage well enough to compare motor/ESC
    load during flight tests; current is currently a manual evidence signal, not
    a trusted safety gate
  - add a blackbox session id plus monotonic timestamp in microseconds so logs
    can be aligned with pilot notes, video, and field events
  - add a pilot-controlled marker or simple firmware-side test marker for
    "clean hover", "FPV characterization", and "abort/land" moments
  - improve log transport reliability: direct USB CDC, onboard flash, or
    Bluetooth/NRF52 blackbox transport so field testing does not depend on
    Pi/mDNS/Wi-Fi behavior near DJI equipment
- Document and prototype the Pi Zero 2 W remote debug gateway:
  - laptop Wi-Fi -> Pi Zero 2 W -> debug probe -> SWD -> FCU
  - Pi runs local RTT logging during flight and keeps logging if Wi-Fi drops
  - MVP assumption: the remote debug server may be able to flash/reset/halt the
    FCU during flight; acceptable for early bring-up, but not acceptable for a
    later safety-reviewed flight configuration
  - expected networks for MVP are home Wi-Fi and a trusted mobile router only
  - add a boot-starting `probe-rs serve` service for the Pi, because onboard
    power will be removed frequently
  - document how to stop/disable the service before manual probe ownership or
    later flight configurations
  - use a strong token before leaving the service bound to the network
  - later add a maintenance/debug-enable mode, e.g. config flag, physical
    button, GPIO strap, or explicit service enable, so remote debug is not left
    active accidentally
  - account for single ownership of `/dev/spidev0.0`; only one `probe-rs`
    process can own the Pi GPIO/SPI SWD backend at a time
  - harden Pi storage for frequent battery removal: no disk-backed swap,
    bounded/volatile logs, and eventually read-only root or overlay where
    practical
  - maintenance/flashing mode must stop the flight logger before owning the probe
  - flashing/reset must be rejected if the FCU armed-state heartbeat is armed, stale, or unknown
- Future RTT firmware migration:
  - replace single-channel `defmt-rtt` with `rtt-target`
  - RTT up-channel 0: `defmt` logs
  - RTT up-channel 1: compact binary telemetry
  - both channels must use non-blocking/no-skip-or-drop behavior; never block the control loop on RTT
  - telemetry task should copy latest state at lower priority and increment drop counters if the RTT buffer is full
